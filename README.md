# TEMPERATURE-RECORDS
**Weekly Temperature Analysis Across U.S. Counties**
**Overview**
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) on weekly average temperature records across various U.S. counties. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the analysis includes:

Grouping weekly data into monthly aggregates.

Creating pivot tables for month-wise temperature summaries.

Identifying the county with the highest total temperature during summer months (Juneâ€“August).

Visualizing temperature trends via bar charts and heatmaps.

**Dataset**
A sample dataset containing weekly average temperature records (County, State, Week, AverageTemperature) for multiple U.S. counties is used in this project. The dataset simulates real-world data with dates ranging from June to August 2024.

Note: For a full-scale analysis, you can replace the sample data with comprehensive datasets from sources like Kaggle or NOAA.

**Features**
Data cleaning and transformation: Date parsing and feature extraction.

Grouping and aggregation: Monthly total temperatures per county.

Pivot table creation: Summarized month-wise temperature matrix.

Summer analysis: Identification of the hottest county over summer months.

Visualizations: Bar plots and heatmaps for clear insights.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Install dependencies via:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Run the provided Python script to perform EDA on the sample dataset.

The script prints:

A month-wise summary table of total temperatures.

The hottest county during summer.

Visualizations will display in separate windows:

Bar chart of summer total temperatures by county.

Heatmap of monthly total temperatures.

Extending the Project
Replace sample data with actual weekly temperature CSV files.

Add seasonal or yearly trend analysis.

Incorporate other meteorological features like precipitation or humidity.

Implement machine learning models for temperature forecasting.
